## Description
Library for working with sound files of the format: `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.wav`.
By work is meant - **playing sound** files in a **straight line** and **in the background**, **obtaining information** about the sound file (**author**, **performer**, **duration**, **bitrate**, and so on).
Playing goes through the `pygame`, and getting information through the `mutagen`.
## Installation
Since I have not yet uploaded the library to `pypi.org`, then you have to enter a direct link to the release:
```
pip install https://github.com/romanin-rf/playsoundsimple.py/releases/download/0.1/playsoundsimple-0.1-py2.py3-none-any.whl
```
