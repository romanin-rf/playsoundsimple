## Description
Library for working with sound files of the format: `.ogg`, `.mp3`, `.wav`.
By work is meant - **playing sound** files in a **straight line** and **in the background**, **obtaining information** about the sound file (**author**, **performer**, **duration**, **bitrate**, and so on).
Playing goes through the `pygame`, and getting information through the `mutagen`.
## Installation
Since I have not yet uploaded the library to `pypi.org`, you need to say any of the files in the rezil and write the command in the folder with this file:
```
pip install <filepath>
```
