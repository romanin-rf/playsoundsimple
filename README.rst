playsoundsimple.py
==================
Description
-----------

Library for working with sound files of the format: ``.ogg``, ``.mp3``, ``.wav``. By work is meant - **playing sound** files in a **straight
line** and **in the background**, **obtaining information** about the sound file (**author**, **performer**, **duration**, **bitrate**, and so on). Playing goes through the ``pygame``, and getting information
through the ``mutagen``. 

Installation
------------ 
Since I have not yet uploaded the library to ``pypi.org``, then you have to enter a direct link to the release:
``pip install playsoundsimple``
